# Thinking Machines Data Engineering Exam

We live and breathe data. So naturally, we try to make our internal processes as
data-driven as possible. Time-tracking allows us to determine our teams'
bandwidth and throughput so we checkin religiously. We do this using a
[a handful of tools](https://stories.thinkingmachin.es/time-tracking-dashboard/)
that we can use without interrupting our work.

For this exam, you are given an anonymized dump of our checkins for the past
year. Your goal is to:

- [ ] Clean the data
- [ ] Load it to your choice of database
- [ ] Create a web service that displays a per-user filtered view of the checkins

Bonus points for:

- Python
- A publicly accessible deployment of your service
- Documentation
- Tests
- Diagrams

We value:

- Communication
- Reproducibility
- Pragmatism
- Code hygiene
